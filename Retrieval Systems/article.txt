Keywords: ChatGPT, Education, Ethical, Responsible 
Introduction 
The rapid pace of technological growth and global interconnectedness has brought about 
substantial changes in society, the economy, and the environment. These changes are collectively 
referred to as megatrends. As the 21st century progresses, these megatrends are expected to 
continue (Haluza & Jungwirth 2023). The field of artificial intelligence has made significant strides 
in recent years, which has led to the development of innovative technologies such as Open AI's 
ChatGPT. The ChatGPT language model is cutting-edge technology that has the potential to bring 
about a sea change in the field of education. As the implementation of ChatGPT in educational 
settings becomes more widespread, it must be done so following principles of responsibility and 
ethics. To this day, ChatGPT is the most advanced chatbot that has ever been created. In contrast 
to previous chatbots, it is capable of producing outstanding text within a matter of seconds, and 
it has generated much buzz and doomsday predictions regarding student assessment in higher 
education as well as a variety of other issues (Rudolph et al., 2023). ChatGPT is a cutting-edge 
language model that is a modification of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) 
language model. Its purpose is to generate text that is indistinguishable from content that was 
authored by people. It can hold conversations with users in a way that is deceptively simple and 
easy to understand. 
Throughout the development of educational technology, many different technological 
advancements have been envisioned as the end of traditional education in its current form. This

has frequently been the result of a euphoric and rather illogical love of technology (Rudolph et 
al. 2023). Since the beginning of the 20th century, many forms of media such as film, radio, 
television, computers, the Internet, mobile technologies, social media, and virtual, augmented, 
mixed, and extended reality have been hailed as having the potential to revolutionize the 
educational system. Nevertheless, throughout the development of educational technology, there 
was frequently insufficient consideration given to how instructors deployed such resources and 
how students interacted with them. Even though machines have significantly altered many aspects 
of daily life in the 20th century, a visitor from the 19th century would feel quite at home in a 
modern classroom. This statement is still relevant because the traditional learning environment 
in physical classrooms has remained fundamentally unchanged (Ferster 2014). 
Students continue to place a high value on credentials, which educational institutions have a 
monopoly on. These credentials include how students are taught as well as research and other 
forms of educational activity. Although there is a long history of viewing technology as a panacea, 
hopes for radical innovation in education are often exaggerated. This is because it turned out that 
credentials continue to be highly valued by students. Having said that, the fact that ChatGPT can 
comprehend and react to human language has made it an extremely useful tool for teachers, 
students, and other types of learners. However, because ChatGPT is becoming more widely used 
in educational settings, its application needs to be governed by principles of responsibility and 
ethics. Responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence in education goes beyond ensuring 
technical accuracy; it involves considering the potential social and ethical implications of its 
implementation, such as concerns about personal privacy and bias, as well as the role that AI will 
play in forming the educational landscape of the future. 
The ethical and responsible use of ChatGPT in educational settings is a complicated and multi
dimensional issue that calls for an approach that is nuanced and interdisciplinary. The necessity 
for the responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence in education has been brought to light 
by recent research. The studies that have been conducted on this topic have focused on topics 
such as privacy, bias, and the potential for AI to contribute to the digital divide (Garrett et al. 
2020, Borenstein & Howard 2021, Holmes et al. 2021, Nguyen et al. 2022). Other academics 
have also stressed the significance of taking into account the role that AI will play in determining 
the course of the future of education, as well as the requirement for multidisciplinary approaches 
to the ethical and responsible application of AI in educational settings (Hoppe et al. 2003, Paulus 
& Langford 2022, Carvalho et al. 2022). The previous research will serve as a foundation for the 
current investigation, which will expand upon previous findings to focus on the ethical and 
responsible application of ChatGPT in educational settings. This study is an investigation of the 
ethical and responsible use of ChatGPT in educational settings, with a particular emphasis on the 
facilitation of lifelong learning. In this session, we will talk about the different ways that ChatGPT 
can be used in education, as well as the opportunities and difficulties that are presented by using 
it. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the responsible and ethical 
use of ChatGPT in education, as well as to promote more research and discussion on this vital 
topic.

This paper employs the crucial document analytical method, wherein individual documents (news 
outlets and blog posts) and physical evidence (published journal articles and books) have been 
reviewed and analyzed, to assess Open AI in Education, the Responsible and Ethical Use of 
ChatGPT Towards Lifelong Learning.  The first thing the author did was perform a global search 
for papers that explored the meaning of Open AI and those that investigated the principles of 
responsible use of AI in education, and ethics of AI in education. It was found that there was a 
total of 55 articles among the three most significant academic websites, Web of Science, Google 
Scholar, and ResearchGate. After that, another round of filtering was done on the articles to 
isolate the ones that discussed the ethics of AI in education, and the responsible use of Chat 
GPT. In the end, a total of 23 publications were selected to include in the study and do the 
subsequent analysis (see figure 2). These specific articles were the key sources of information 
that were used to create the findings that were supplied and spoken about in this research. 
Following the completion of the investigation, a procedure known as thematic data analysis was 
performed on the many problems that were discovered to categorize them into themes. The 
procedure that was utilized to get the articles posted on a variety of reliable websites is broken 
down into steps and depicted in the diagram that can be found below in Figure 1.

A Brief History of OpenAI and ChatGTP 
OpenAI is a research laboratory for artificial intelligence that was founded in San Francisco to 
promote and create "friendly AI" for the benefit of humans. When the company was first 
launched, prominent figures in the technology industry like as Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter 
Thiel, Greg Brockman, and Sam Altman were among those responsible for launching it. While 
Altman is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI now, Brockman acts as the company's President. 
It is stated in the mission statement for OpenAI that the organization's ultimate goal is to create 
"artificial general intelligence." Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly improve many 
different industries, and the founders of OpenAI believe that it should be developed safely and 
beneficially, with open-source software and advanced AI tools being available without restrictions 
based on intellectual property. In addition, they believe that artificial intelligence should be 
developed in a manner that will allow it to significantly improve many different industries. OpenAI 
became a for-profit company in 2019, after having previously operated as a nonprofit organization. 
As a part of this move, Microsoft made an investment of one billion dollars in OpenAI, and 
OpenAI licensed its most recent language model, GPT-3, solely to Microsoft. Both of these events 
took place in 2018. Since that time, Microsoft has increased its prior investment in OpenAI by an 
additional $2 billion, and the corporation is currently in discussions to increase that investment 
by an additional $10 billion. The shift in OpenAI's approach to finance has cast questions on the 
organization's commitment to democratizing artificial intelligence as well as its openness and 
transparency throughout the process. The most cutting-edge and potent language model that has 
ever been produced is GPT-3, which was made available to the public in the year 2020. It does 
this by employing a technique known as deep learning to produce text. 
Chat GPT The Meaning 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
The ChatGPT language model was developed by OpenAI, which is widely recognized as one of 
the most influential organizations in the field of artificial intelligence research. The architecture 
known as GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), which was initially introduced by OpenAI 
in 2018, serves as the basis for this system. The first version of the GPT model was trained on a 
vast amount of text data obtained from the internet by utilizing a deep learning technique known 
as transformers. This training took place on data acquired from the internet. It was able to 
generate text that was almost indistinguishable from writing done by humans as a result of this. 
OpenAI decided to create GPT-2, which is a substantially improved and more resilient iteration 
of the GPT model, because of the tremendous success that the first version of the GPT model 
experienced. Despite this, OpenAI has decided not to make the full version of GPT-2 available 
to the public because of worries surrounding the model's potential for inappropriate use. In the 
year 2020, OpenAI made available the GPT-3 language model for the public to use. It is the most 
advanced language model that has ever been created and can perform a wide variety of tasks that 
involve the processing of natural languages. Some examples of these tasks include the translation 
of languages, the summarization of information, the answering of questions, and the generation 
of text. The ChatGPT test is a variant of the GPT-3 protocol that has been optimized for 
conversational tasks such as providing replies to questions presented in natural language. This 
optimization was accomplished by taking the GPT-3 exam and modifying it specifically for 
conversational tasks. As a result of this, it is of great use in the development of chatbots and 
other artificial intelligence applications that involve dialogue (Rudolph et al. 2023). The 
implementation of ChatGPT in educational settings carries with it the potential to significantly 
improve students' educational experiences; nevertheless, the technology must be utilized 
responsibly and ethically. This involves making sure that students continue to develop their ability 
to think critically and find solutions to problems, as well as taking steps to reduce any existing 
prejudices and forms of discrimination. The responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT towards 
lifelong learning is an essential component of the larger discourse on AI ethics. To guarantee that 
the technology is used in ways that promote beneficial results for students and society, continual 
research and monitoring are required. 
Empirical Literature Review 
The Open AI in Education literature review centres its attention on the ethical and appropriate 
usage of ChatGPT toward the pursuit of lifelong learning. ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language 
model that was developed by OpenAI. It has been making waves in the world of artificial 
intelligence (AI) as well as natural language processing (NLP). However, because it is being used 
more frequently in a wide variety of applications, one of which being education, there is a growing 
worry regarding the ethical and responsible use of technology of this kind. ChatGPT can 
completely transform the method by which students acquire knowledge and access information 
within the realm of education. Students can benefit from learning opportunities that are both 
tailored to their interests and intellectually stimulating thanks to the capability of the model to 
produce responses that mimic those of humans. Learning may also be made more accessible to 
students all around the world because of ChatGPT's capability of handling several languages as 
well as a wide variety of subject matters. However, the implementation of ChatGPT in 
educational settings gives rise to questions about the user's ethical and responsible behaviour. 
Because of its sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities, ChatGPT runs the potential of 
reinforcing preexisting prejudices and forms of discrimination, which could result in learning 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
experiences that are unequal and unfair. In addition, the implementation of such technology in 
educational settings may cause students to become less adept at critical thinking since they may 
come to rely excessively on the responses that are generated by AI rather than coming up with 
their ideas. 
Rudolph et al. (2023) argued that ChatGPT is the world's most advanced chatbot so far because, 
unlike other chatbots, it can create impressive prose within seconds, and it has created much 
hype and doomsday predictions when it comes to the assessment of students in higher education 
as well as a variety of other topics. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model, according to 
Rudolph et al. (2023). It is a variant of OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) 
language model, which was developed to generate writing that is indistinguishable from text 
written by humans. Rudolph et al. (2023) feel that ChatGPT is capable of engaging in discussion 
with users in a way that gives the impression of being natural and straightforward. Rudolph et al. 
(2023) provided a condensed summary of OpenAI's history, which is the organization that 
developed ChatGPT. We bring attention to the fundamental shift from a model of a not-for
profit organization to one of a commercial enterprise. According to Rudolph et al. (2023), our 
review is one of the first academic journal publications to be peer-reviewed and investigate the 
significance of ChatGPT for higher education, particularly in the areas of evaluation, learning, and 
teaching. Rudolph et al. (2023), focus on the technology's implications for higher education and 
discuss what the future holds for learning, teaching, and assessment in higher education in the 
context of artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT. Rudolph et al. (2023) provided a 
description of ChatGPT's functionality as well as a summary of its strengths and limitations. 
Rudolph et al. (2023) examine student-facing, teacher-facing, and system-facing applications, as 
well as potential dangers in the field of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd). They place 
ChatGPT into the context of current research on artificial intelligence in education (AIEd). 
In the final section of this paper, Rudolph et al. (2023),  offer some recommendations for students, 
professors, and institutions of higher education.  
Thurzo et al. (2023) presented an up-to-date summary of the impending changes and a brief study 
of the influential breakthroughs in the application of AI in dentistry education since the year 2020. 
This research was published in the journal Dental Education. In addition, Thurzo et al. (2023) 
presented a manual for an updated dental curriculum that may be used for both undergraduate 
and postgraduate education. This manual was written in the context of developments in AI 
applications and the influence these developments have had on dentistry. It shouldn't come as a 
surprise that the majority of dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to evaluate AI 
applications because they were not taught to do so, as stated by Thurzo et al. (2023). Additionally, 
Thurzo et al. (2023) pointed out that recent years have seen exponential growth in the 
development of AI technologies. According to Thurzo and colleagues (2023), factual reliability 
and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.'s ChatGPT are regarded as crucial turning moments in the 
era of generative artificial intelligence (AI). According to Thurzo et al. (2023), when advanced 
deep-learning algorithms take over the clinical fields of dentistry and redefine diagnosis, treatment 
planning, management, and telemedicine screening, it is inevitable that dental institution curricula 
will need to be updated. According to Thurzo et al. (2023), recent advancements in AI language 
models will cause a shift in how dentists communicate with their patients. As a result, the 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
fundamentals of dental education, such as the writing of essays, theses, or scientific papers, would 
need to be modified. 
On the other hand, Thurzo et al. (2023) suggest that there is a rising worry about its ethical and 
legal consequences and that greater consensus is required for the safe and responsible 
deployment of AI in dental education. Pfeffer et al. (no date) argued that large language models 
represent a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, with the underlying 
technology as the key to further innovations. Large language models are here to stay, despite 
critical views and even bans within communities and regions. Pfeffer et al. (no date) addressed 
the possible benefits and problems of educational uses of large language models, from the 
perspectives of both students and teachers. The authors focused on the benefits of using large 
language models. Pfeffer and colleagues (no date given) talked about the current state of massive 
language models and the uses that they have. After that, we focus on how these models might be 
utilized to produce educational content, enhance student engagement and interaction, and tailor 
learning experiences. Pfeffer et al. (no date) argue that large language models in education demand 
both educators and students to create sets of areas of expertise and information literacy 
necessary to comprehend the technology as well as the constraints and unexpected brittleness 
of such systems. This is about the challenges that are presented. In addition, Pfeffer and colleagues 
(no date) argued that a clear strategy within school institutions and a clear teaching approach 
with a strong concentration on critical thinking and strategies for fact-checking are required to 
integrate and make full use of large language models in classroom styles and teaching curricula. 
This is necessary to take full advantage of the benefits that large language models offer. Pfeffer et 
al. (no date) also presented other obstacles, some of which are not exclusive to the application 
of AI in education. These challenges include the potential for bias in the output, the requirement 
of continual human monitoring, and the potential for misuse. Pfeffer et al. (no date) feel that if 
these difficulties are handled wisely, they can offer insights and possibilities in education settings 
to acquaint students with potential social biases, criticalities, and risks of AI application early on 
in their academic careers. 
According to Qadir (2022), engineering education is perpetually changing to keep pace with the 
most recent advances in technology and to adapt to the shifting requirements of the engineering 
industry. According to Qadir (2022), the application of generative artificial intelligence 
technologies in this industry, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent, is one of the exciting 
developments that has recently taken place. Students can receive individualized feedback and 
explanations with ChatGPT, which also enables the creation of realistic virtual simulations for 
hands-on learning opportunities. This has the potential to make students' educational experiences 
more productive and personalized. Qadir (2022), on the other hand, believes that it is necessary 
to take into account the constraints imposed by this technology. According to Qadir (2022), 
ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as the data that they use to train 
themselves, and they may perpetuate biases or even generate and propagate false information. In 
addition, Qadir (2022) argued that the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns. 
These concerns include the possibility that students will use the technology in an unethical or 
dishonest manner, as well as the possibility that humans will become unemployed as a result of 
technology rendering their jobs obsolete. In conclusion, Qadir (2022) believes that engineering 
educators must comprehend the implications of this innovation and study how to make 
adjustments to the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
engineers will be able to realize the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative 
consequences. Qadir's research was published in the journal Engineering Education and Research 
in 2022. 
Zhuo et al. (2023) claimed that recent advances in natural language processing have made it 
possible to synthesize and comprehend coherent text in an open-ended manner. This has allowed 
the theoretical techniques to be translated into practical implementations. According to Zhuo et 
al. (2023), the huge language model has had a substantial impact on a variety of enterprises, 
including those that develop a report summarizing software and copywriters. Large language 
models may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, as suggested by the findings of Zhuo et al. (2023), 
which poses ethical and societal hazards in the form of consequences deriving from 
irresponsibility. As a result, large-scale standards for accountable big language models must be 
constructed following the recommendations made by Zhuo et al (2023). Zhuo et al. (2023) 
further educate future efforts on responsibly constructing ethical large language models, we 
perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical 
features of ethical dangers in recent large language models. Zhuo et al. (2023) further educate 
future efforts on constructing ethical large language models. The potential of artificial intelligence 
(AI) to address social megatrends was also investigated by Haluza and Jungwirth (2023), with a 
particular emphasis on OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 as the subject of their 
research (GPT-3). 
To accomplish this, Haluza and Jungwirth (2023) utilized GPT-3 to investigate the potential 
benefits of AI in the context of digitization, urbanization, globalization, climate change, automation 
and mobility, global health challenges, and an ageing population. Within the scope of this study, 
Haluza and Jungwirth (2023) considered not only the topic of sustainability but also that of rising 
markets. The only way to interact with GPT-3 was through a series of predetermined questions, 
and the responses it generated were examined. According to the findings presented by Haluza 
and Jungwirth (2023), AI has the potential to considerably enhance our comprehension of these 
tendencies by illuminating how their manifestations evolve and suggesting potential responses to 
the challenges they provide. Further, Haluza and Jungwirth (2023) claimed that more research is 
required to assess how effective AI will be in successfully tackling these challenges; nonetheless, 
the first findings are encouraging. According to Haluza and Jungwirth (2023), additional research 
needs to be conducted to determine how to make the most effective use of emerging 
technologies such as GPT-3 when addressing these difficulties. Last but not least, Haluza and 
Jungwirth (2023) concluded that while there is still a great deal of work to be done before any 
tangible effects can be seen from utilizing AI tools such as GPT-3 on societal mega-trends, early 
indications suggest that it may have a positive impact if used correctly. This is although there is 
still a great deal of work left to be done before any such effects can be seen. 
Use of ChatGPT for education: Challenges 
It is one of the key reasons why the use of ChatGPT for grading written tasks is discouraged 
because of the potential threat that it poses to more conventional methods of assessing written 
work, such as essays. Some educators are afraid that students will outsource their work to 
ChatGPT because the platform can rapidly generate acceptable text. This makes it more difficult 
to identify instances of plagiarism, which causes some educators to be concerned (Rudolph et al. 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
2023). However, this may be due to a reluctance to alter the methods that are used to evaluate 
the learning of students. Written assignments are commonly criticized for being uninteresting 
and ineffective in determining students' levels of knowledge and skills; however, this may be due 
to a reluctance to modify the methods that are used to evaluate the learning of students. Another 
issue that causes some cause for concern is the fact that ChatGPT, which is effectively just a text
generating machine, does not grasp the information it generates, nor does it judge whether or 
not it is accurate or relevant. It is feasible that this will result in regulations that ban its utilization; 
nevertheless, it is also conceivable that ChatGPT technology will become ubiquitous before 
institutions have the time to alter their policies. An approach that focuses on correcting the issues 
that have been caused by ChatGPT while also taking into account the potential benefits and 
drawbacks of the platform would be more effective. When an educational piece of technology 
that has the potential to revolutionize the field is made available to the public, it is the 
responsibility of educators and policymakers to address any problems that may arise as a result 
of its implementation and to devise strategies to do away with educational practices that are 
inefficient. The instance of a Chinese schoolgirl who used a machine to copy enormous amounts 
of text serves as an illustration of how important it is to develop a responsible approach when 
making use of technology in educational settings. 
Use of ChatGPT for Education: Opportunities 
The fact that ChatGPT is capable of writing essays paves the opportunity for fresh and innovative 
methods to be used in educational settings. Many specialists in the field, such as McMurtrie (2022) 
and Sharples (2022), believe that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, will 
soon be a vital component of education, and they propose making use of technology to enhance 
learning. One way that assessment procedures can be improved is by giving teachers the tools 
they need to use testing both as a tool for learning and as a means of learning itself. In addition, 
ChatGPT can be leveraged to build teaching approaches, boost student participation and 
teamwork, and promote hands-on, experiential learning. Even though ChatGPT is a technology 
that can be considered disruptive, it presents a tremendous opportunity to modernize the 
educational system. In a word, the implementation of ChatGPT in the context of an educational 
institution brings with it a wide range of opportunities as well as challenges for teachers. The 
capability of ChatGPT to generate essays is seen by some as a potential risk to traditional methods 
of evaluating students, but it also gives teachers the chance to develop brand-new approaches to 
testing students' knowledge and skills. It is possible to use ChatGPT to improve the evaluation 
capabilities of instructors, stimulate collaboration and teamwork among students, and give 
students more possibilities to learn via trial and experience. In conclusion, ChatGPT is a 
technology that is considered as being disruptive in the education sector; nonetheless, it has the 
potential to transform education via innovation. 
Responsible And Ethical Use of ChatGPT in Education  
To ensure that ChatGPT is utilized in a manner that is safe, fair, and courteous to students, 
instructors, and all other stakeholders, it is necessary to adhere to responsible and ethical 
practices while implementing the technology in educational settings. The application of artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology in educational settings, such as ChatGPT, can bring about a great 
many benefits; nevertheless, it also raises problems regarding ethics and responsibility.

 Figure 2: Responsible and Ethical Use of ChatGPT in Education 
The obligations and ethical usage of ChatGPT in the education sector are outlined in the figure 
that can be found above labelled as Figure 2. These responsibilities include respect for privacy, 
fairness and non-discrimination, transparency in the use of ChatGPT, and a few more.  
Respect For Privacy 
To start, protecting the privacy of users' data is a primary priority. Because ChatGPT is trained 
on enormous volumes of data obtained from the internet, it is essential to ensure that the 
personal data of students is safeguarded and not put to inappropriate use. Before using ChatGPT 
in the classroom, educators should inform students about how their data is gathered, used, and 
kept and acquire their consent. In addition, students should be aware of the security measures 
that are in place to protect their data. When it comes to the application of ChatGPT in the realm 
of education, the protection of users' personal information is an essential concern. It is imperative 
that the confidentiality of all individuals participating in the educational process, including students, 
teachers, and anybody else, is always maintained. The General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) in Europe and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United 
States both require organizations to protect the personal data of individuals (Botha et al. 2017, 
Berger 2022). These laws are similar in that they require organizations to do whatever they can 
to protect the personal data of individuals, including students. This comprises student 
information, grades, and assessment results that were gathered through the use of ChatGPT in 
the educational setting. Should one fail to preserve sensitive data, one may face serious 
repercussions in both the legal and financial spheres.

Again, the usage of ChatGPT in educational settings frequently entails the communication of 
private information, such as grades, student performance, and personal particulars. To maintain 
the confidentiality of the individuals who are involved, it is necessary to prevent unauthorized 
access to, use of, or disclosure of the information in question. When it comes to the learning 
process, trust is an essential component (Tartavulea et al. 2020, Myskja 2023). When students, 
teachers, and other individuals participating in education have faith that the confidentiality of their 
personal information will be maintained, they are more likely to give their full attention and 
participation to the learning process. On the other side, if a person's right to privacy is violated 
in any way, the trust may be broken, which may have a detrimental effect not only on the 
outcomes of learning but also on overall contentment. The use of ChatGPT in educational settings 
should be conceived of and carried out in a manner that is consistent with ethical principles such 
as informed consent, transparency, and accountability. Respecting individuals' right to privacy is 
an ethical obligation because it demonstrates respect for individuals and their rights. When it 
comes to the educational use of ChatGPT, protecting users' privacy is of the utmost importance. 
It is necessary to take appropriate safeguards to safeguard the personal data of those involved in 
the educational process, to maintain trust, and to ensure that the use of ChatGPT is consistent 
with ethical principles. These three goals must be met for ChatGPT to be used ethically. 
Fairness and Non-Discrimination 
It is possible for ChatGPT to exhibit bias, particularly in the language that it was trained on. It is 
essential to be aware of this, as well as to provide a suitable context when utilizing ChatGPT in 
the classroom setting. The potential for harm should also be brought to the attention of 
educators, particularly if ChatGPT is used as a grading or evaluation tool for pupils. Students shall 
not be subjected to bias, discrimination, or unfair treatment because of their use of ChatGPT, 
regardless of variables such as their colour, gender, or socioeconomic background. Because AI 
algorithms like ChatGPT can perpetuate and magnify existing biases, prejudices, and 
discrimination, fairness and non-discrimination must be strictly adhered to whenever ChatGPT 
is used in educational settings. Pupils may be treated unfairly and unequally if these biases are not 
recognized and remedied immediately. As a result, it is essential to make certain that ChatGPT 
and other AI systems are conceived, developed, and used in a fair and non-discriminatory manner 
at every stage of the process. Consider the possibility of using ChatGPT to assign grades to 
student essays, for instance. Students who come from underrepresented groups may have their 
essays receive unjust grades because the training data that was used to train ChatGPT was 
skewed toward a certain set of people. This could lead to more marginalization of populations 
that are already at a disadvantage in terms of education and could further exacerbate existing 
educational gaps. Furthermore, language models like ChatGPT can propagate and magnify 
unwanted preconceptions, biases, and prejudices. This is a risk that comes with using these 
models. When employed in educational contexts, ChatGPT may provide responses that are 
prejudiced and discriminatory, for instance, if the training data that was used to train it had 
unfavourable prejudices about particular groups. Students, instructors, and other members of the 
educational community may suffer because of this. Because of this, it is essential to conduct an 
in-depth analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT and address the possibility 
of discrimination and bias before implementing them in educational contexts. 
Chatgpt is not a Substitute for Human Teachers 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
ChatGPT is not intended to replace in-person instruction from qualified instructors. It ought to 
be regarded as a device that supplements classroom instruction and student learning rather than 
one that supplants it. Rather than depending solely on the AI tool to carry out all of the necessary 
tasks, teachers should utilize ChatGPT in a manner that improves their methods of instruction 
and encourages students to engage in analytical and critical thinking. In recent years, there has 
been a lot of discussion over the application of artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, in the 
classroom setting. It is important to note that even though ChatGPT presents several 
opportunities for improvement in educational settings, it is not intended to take the place of 
actual instructors. This is true for several different reasons, all of which are valid. The human 
connection that exists between an instructor and a student can never be replaced by ChatGPT. 
The relationship that exists between a teacher and their pupils is among the most essential 
components of the educational process. Teachers can create connections with their pupils and 
gain an understanding of the student's particular requirements, as well as their strengths and 
weaknesses (Kim 2020, Attard & Holmes 2020, Alam 2022). On the other hand, ChatGPT is only 
a machine that is incapable of developing meaningful connections with its users (the students). 
The goal of education should not be limited to the dissemination of information but should also 
include the cultivation of interpersonal ties and relationships. It is largely up to the teachers to 
establish an atmosphere in the classroom that is encouraging and welcoming to students of all 
backgrounds. Because it is an AI language model, ChatGPT does not possess the emotional 
intelligence, empathy, or interpersonal skills that human teachers do. Because of this, it is difficult 
for ChatGPT to comprehend the unique requirements of each student, to offer individualized 
assistance, and to produce a learning environment that is positive and engaging. Creativity and 
analytical thinking are not strong points of ChatGPT. Teachers receive training to develop their 
creative and critical thinking skills, which enables them to provide individualized support and 
direction to the students in their classrooms. On the other hand, ChatGPT is constrained by the 
programming and algorithms that it uses, and as a result, it is unable to think creatively or critically 
in the same way that a human instructor can. The field of education is always shifting and 
developing(Mhlanga 2021, Mhlanga 2022, Mhlanga 2023). The ever-evolving requirements of 
students can be accommodated by human instructors, who can also add novel concepts and 
strategies into their lessons and adjust their approach to instruction in response to the comments 
and suggestions of their pupils. On the other hand, ChatGPT operates based on the data it was 
trained on and is unable to alter its approach to match the particular requirements of individual 
students or courses. 
ChatGPT is not Capable of Comprehending The Surrounding Context. 
In the field of education, it is frequently vital to have a solid understanding of the environment in 
which a student is functioning to offer the most pertinent assistance and direction (Mahoney et 
al. 2021, Alam 2022). This context takes into account the student's culture, background, and the 
experiences they've had throughout their life (Mahoney et al. 2021, Alam 2022 Adams et al.2022). 
ChatGPT, being a machine, is not capable of comprehending or appreciating these aspects in the 
same manner that a human educator can do so. To reiterate, ChatGPT is unable to deliver either 
hands-on training or experiential education. The greatest way for many children to learn is 
through opportunities for hands-on and experiential learning (LeBaron et al. 2019, Jacobs 2020). 
It is in the best position of those who teach to provide these possibilities, and they can do so 
with hands-on projects, laboratory experiments, or field trips learning (LeBaron et al. 2019, Jacobs 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
2020). On the other hand, ChatGPT is not able to deliver these kinds of educational opportunities 
as effectively as other platforms can. Creativity, invention, and originality are all things that can 
be brought to the classroom by human teachers. They are capable of developing interesting 
courses, employing unique teaching approaches, and encouraging students to think critically and 
creatively outside of the box. Because it is an AI model, ChatGPT functions according to pre
programmed algorithms and does not have the same level of creativity and originality as human 
instructors have. In conclusion, although ChatGPT has the prospective to play a part in the field 
of education, it should not be seen as a replacement for actual teachers. The talents, experiences, 
and points of view that human teachers bring into the classroom cannot be reproduced by a 
machine in any way, shape, or form. It is essential to be aware of the constraints imposed by 
ChatGPT and to make certain that the platform is applied in ways that complement and do not 
supplant the role of human educators. 
Responsible AI, It's Important to Educate Students About AI And Its Limitations.  
Students need to be aware that ChatGPT is not a sentient creature but rather an artificial 
intelligence model with the ability to generate text. Students should be encouraged to challenge 
the output of ChatGPT, and teachers should assist students in developing a critical and educated 
viewpoint on the application of artificial intelligence in the classroom. When using ChatGPT in 
the classroom, it is essential to educate students about artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the 
limitations of AI for several reasons. To begin, artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT 
are not flawless, and students must understand the limitations and biases that these systems have. 
For instance, ChatGPT was trained on a massive body of textual material sourced from the 
internet, which may contain information that is unreliable, biased, or deceptive. As a consequence 
of this, pupils need to be able to conduct an in-depth analysis of the data that is produced by 
ChatGPT and comprehend how to discriminate between genuine and unreliable sources of 
information. Second, students need to understand the potential ethical and social ramifications 
that artificial intelligence could have. For instance, if ChatGPT is used to assess students' essays 
or provide feedback to them, there is a possibility that it will perpetuate existing biases and 
prolong unfairness. This is a risk that ChatGPT poses. Students have a responsibility to be aware 
of these problems and to comprehend the various solutions available. Third, for students to 
successfully traverse a technological landscape that is always evolving, they need to be prepared 
with the knowledge and skills necessary to do so. 
Students need to understand how artificial intelligence works, as well as its capabilities and 
limitations since AI continues to progress and become more pervasive (Wong et al. 2020, Alam 
2022). Because of this, they will be equipped with the knowledge and abilities necessary to make 
educated judgments regarding the application of AI in their future employment and their personal 
lives. Last but not least, educators can contribute to the development of a more educated and 
responsible connection between humans and AI by teaching students about the limitations of AI. 
This can help ensure that AI is employed in a way that is not only safe but also ethical and useful 
to society. Educating students about artificial intelligence (AI) and the limitations of AI is important 
for the development of critical thinking, the promotion of ethical and responsible use of AI, and 
the equipping of students with the skills and knowledge they need to navigate a technological 
landscape that is rapidly changing.

Transparency in the Use of Chat GPT 
It is also essential to be open and honest about the implementation of ChatGPT in educational 
settings and to offer frequent forums in which students and teachers can debate the moral and 
responsible application of artificial intelligence (AI). This can take the form of recurring 
workshops, discussion groups, or forums, at which participants can ruminate on the merits and 
drawbacks of utilizing AI in educational settings, as well as formulate suggestions for its 
responsible and ethical application. Because it guarantees that students, professors, and 
educational institutions understand how the technology works and what it is capable of doing, 
transparency is a crucial feature of adopting ChatGPT in education. Both students and teachers 
must understand how artificial intelligence technology such as ChatGPT processes information 
and creates responses before implementing the technology in educational settings. This assists in 
the elimination of any ambiguities or misconceptions that may develop and ensures that the 
technology is used ethically and responsibly(Mhlanga 2022 Rodgers et al. 2023). In the context of 
education, examples of transparent use of ChatGPT could include informing students about the 
algorithms and data sources used by the technology, as well as describing how it processes and 
creates responses. 
This knowledge may be made accessible in a variety of formats, such as educational materials or 
guides for academic institutions and their respective students and professors. In addition, 
educational institutions can make it a priority to utilize open-source or transparent AI technology 
to ensure that students and teachers have access to the source code and underlying data. This 
can be accomplished by making the adoption of open-source or transparent AI technology a 
priority. The provision of students with a clear explanation of the potential biases and limitations 
of the technology used in the classroom is another illustration of the transparent nature of the 
use of ChatGPT in educational settings. It is essential, for instance, that students be made aware 
of the fact that artificial intelligence algorithms, such as ChatGPT, are only as objective as the data 
they are trained on. The replies that are generated by the technology are susceptible to reflecting 
any biases that may be present in the training data. Students can be better prepared to critically 
analyze and comprehend the replies generated by ChatGPT if they are educated about the 
constraints described here and how they apply. Transparency is of the utmost importance while 
utilizing ChatGPT in educational settings because it not only assists in fostering an ethical and 
responsible utilization of the technology but also provides students with a better comprehension 
of the latter's capabilities and restrictions. This gives students the ability to use ChatGPT in an 
informed manner and also ensures that the technology is utilized in a manner that is in line with 
the core values and guiding principles of the educational establishment in which they are enrolled. 
In conclusion, the use of ChatGPT in education that is responsible and ethical needs an 
understanding of potential biases and limitations, security of students' data, transparency in its 
usage, and critical evaluation of the influence it has on the teaching and learning process. It is the 
role of educators to assist students in forming well-informed and analytical viewpoints on artificial 
intelligence (AI) and to utilize AI technologies such as ChatGPT in a manner that supplements, 
rather than replaces, their teaching. 
Accuracy of Information 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4354422
The accuracy of the information is very significant in the field of education since it guarantees that 
the material that is being taught and learned is accurate, trustworthy, and credible. When it comes 
to the instruction of scientific principles, providing accurate information is quite necessary, as 
providing the material that is not accurate might lead to misunderstandings and misconceptions. 
For instance, if a student is taught that the world is flat, they will have an incorrect grasp of 
geography, astronomy, and any other relevant disciplines that are taught in conjunction with this 
topic. Accurate knowledge is necessary for history lectures to comprehend the significance of 
the past to the present and how it has evolved. If a student is led to believe that that the first 
black president of South Africa was Thabo Mbeki or George Washington served as the first 
president of France rather than the United States, then that student will have an incorrect grasp 
of the history of South Africa or the United States. Accuracy is essential in mathematics for both 
the problem-solving process and the comprehension of mathematical concepts (Al-Mutawah et 
al. 2019, Santia & Sutawidjadja 2019). If a pupil is taught that adding two and four equals five, then 
they will struggle to solve arithmetic problems and understand more sophisticated mathematical 
ideas that build upon this fundamental understanding. As a result, it is essential to make certain 
that the information that is offered by ChatGPT as well as any other instrument that is utilized in 
the educational process is accurate. Both teachers and students need to exercise critical thinking 
when it comes to the information they are given and check it with reliable sources. 
Conclusion and Policy Recommendations 
Significant shifts have taken place in society, the economy, and the environment as a direct result 
of the accelerated rate of technological advancement and increased global interconnectedness. In 
recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has made considerable advancements, which has 
resulted in the development of cutting-edge technologies like Open AI's ChatGPT. The ChatGPT 
language model is a cutting-edge piece of technology that can usher in a period of profound 
transformation within the field of education. This article's goals are to (1) provide a complete 
evaluation of the responsible and ethical usage of ChatGPT in education, and (2) encourage 
additional research and discussion on this extremely important topic. The document analytical 
method was used in the research, and it was found that for ChatGPT to be used in education, it 
is essential to ensure that privacy is respected, that there is fairness and non-discrimination, that 
there is transparency in the use of ChatGPT, and that there are a few other conditions outlined 
in the research. According to the findings of this research, it is advised that all of these ideas be 
followed to guarantee that the integrity and responsibility of the education sector are preserved 
all over the world.
